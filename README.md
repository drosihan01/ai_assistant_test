## AI Assistant Test

In this repo I have made two dummy AI assistants using elevenlabs (scribe v1 and flash v2.5) and openAI (gpt 4o).

Carmen is a voice-activated AI assistant trained in espionage, sarcasm, and a little flirty. You can keep talking to her and when you are silent it will know to stop.

> "Intel confirmed. And darling, I make it look good."

Tami is a shop floor assistant that is always listening in the background. You press space to trigger her response but she is able to discern between customer and team member

> "That should be in the homewares section. Have a look at isle 2"
